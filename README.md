This is a Vagrant Ansible control box because it's not supported on Windows

## Install

- Install prereqs (Windows 7):
  - Virtualbox 5.0.40
  - Vagrant 1.8.7

## TODO
- Set up synced folder for ansible projects

- Update docs with the shared stuff (vagrant 1.9.3 and vbox 5.1.18)
- Work on ansible projects
- Merge the two Vagrantfiles
- Create a private network with at least two guest VMs that I can screw with
